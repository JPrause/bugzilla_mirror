The Bugzilla Mirror is an application designed to simplify and improve the
experience of using Bugzilla.  The application mirrors all of the bugs of a
specific project.  Although it doesn't mirror *all* of the data provided by
Bugzilla, such as attachments, having less data in a simpler schema means that
query performance is dramatically increased.
